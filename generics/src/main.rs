//  The prompt says: Another way we could implement largest is
// for the function to return a reference to a T value in the slice.
// If we change the return type to &T instead of T, thereby changing
//  the body of the function to return a reference, we wouldnâ€™t need
// the Clone or Copy trait bounds and we could avoid heap allocations.
// So I cleared the Copy here and tried everything I could think of to return
// a reference to &T but nothing even lets me compile the code.
// What am i doing wrong?
fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
